        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish combines the five main basic tastes: sourness of the lime, the spiciness of the chili, saltiness and savoriness of the fish sauce, and sweetness of palm sugar. The ingredients are mixed and pounded in a mortar, which is reflected in the Khmer, Lao and Thai names for the dish that literally mean "pounded papaya".</p>
        <p>In Thailand, it is customary that a customer ask the preparer to make the dish suited to his or her tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as ส้มตำลาว or som tam Lao or simply as tam Lao and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as som tam Thai.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Thai chillies</li>
            <li>2 clove garlic</li>
            <li>2 tbsp shelled roasted peanuts</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp palm sugar</li> 
            <li>2 limes</li> 
            <li>1 tbsp dried shrimp optional</li> 
            <li>1-2 tomatoes use 1 if you have a big one</li> 
            <li>1 handful slivered green papaya</li>
            <li>Garnish
                <ul>
                    <li>Green Cabbage</li>
                    <li>Thai sweet basil</li>
                    <li>Long-beans</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>After washing the green papaya, peel off the skin using a carrot peeler. You can then either use a cheese grater to shave the papaya, or you can do it the traditional way and hack at the papaya with your knife until there are numerous vertical cuts, then shave off the top layer into thin slivers, and repeat. I like the traditional method as you get bigger, un-even, pieces of green papaya. Cut enough green papaya to have a big handful worth for this recipe.</li> 
            <li>Add 2 cloves of peeled garlic and 5 chillies (or however many you like) to the mortar. Pound them for a few seconds until the garlic is crushed and chilies are reduced to small bits.</li> 
            <li>Add ½ tablespoon of palm sugar, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and then squeeze the juice from 1 – 2 limes into the mortar. You can always start with less seasoning and add more to your liking.</li> 
            <li>Mix and pound the dressing, making sure the palm sugar gets fully dissolved into the liquid (so no one bites into a chunk of pure palm sugar).</li> 
            <li>Add about 1 tablespoon of roasted peanuts (no need to measure, just grab some with your hand), 1 tablespoon of dried shrimp, and then roughly slice in the tomatoes into the mortar.</li> 
            <li>Pound the mixture for about 30 seconds, lightly breaking up the tomatoes, shrimp, and peanuts. No need to pound too hard.</li> 
        </ol>
