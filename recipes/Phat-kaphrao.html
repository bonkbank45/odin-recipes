        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Phat kaphrao consists of meat such as pork, chicken, beef, and seafood stir fried with Thai holy basil and garlic. It is served with rice and topped up (optional) with fried eggs or khai dao (Thai: ไข่ดาว). The main seasonings are soy sauce, Thai fish sauce, oyster sauce (optional), cane sugar, and bird's eye chili.</p>
        <p>Over time, phat kaphrao has evolved with the addition of other ingredients such as Chinese century eggs and Thai local vegetables, namely asparagus beans, baby corns, onions, carrots, cowpeas, banana peppers, mushrooms, Chinese kales, bamboo shoots and coconut shoots. However, adding vegetables in phat kaphrao is also seen as an effort to reduce the cost of meat and increase profit margins on the part of food vendors.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup Ground Pork Loin</li>
            <li>2 Cups Holy basil (Krapow Basil Leaves)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Yardlong beans (or other green bean, cut into 1/2 inch pieces)</li> 
            <li>1 - 4 Thai Hot Chilies (or other spicy red chili)</li>
            <li>2 - 4 Cloves Garlic (Large cloves, or more if using small cloves)</li> 
            <li>2 Tablespoons Oyster Sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Light Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dark Sweet Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Water(or less, as needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In order for your Pad Krapow to have the right flavor, you really need to use the type of basil that we call Krapow. Krapow is similar in flavor to Holy Basil. It has a strong spicy scent, similar to cloves, or cinnamon. Don't use Horapah, the other kind of basil used in Thai cooking that is commonly called Thai Basil. That has the wrong flavor completely.</li>
            <li>Measure and prepare the ingredients. Pluck the leaves from your Krapow and cut the green beans into 1/2 inch pieces. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic and chilies. Not too finely crushed, just enough to get the flavors out. You can also just chop them if you want.</li>
            <li>If you are planning to serve a fried egg on the side, then you should fry it before you cook the Pad Krapow. If you want to make a real Kai Dow, then follow the video for my tips, otherwise any ordinary fried egg will still taste great with this dish.</li>
            <li>Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium to high heat, and add about 1 - 2 Tablespoon of vegetable oil. When the oil gets hot, add the crushed garlic and chilies. Fry for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped meat to the pan and mix it in well with the chilies and garlic. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until most of the pink color is gone from the meat and you can tell that it is nearly cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the oyster sauce and light soy sauce to the meat and mix it in well. Fry for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and green beans to the pan and stir well. Fry for about 30 seconds, or until you are sure the sugar is all melted.</li>
            <li>Add the dark sweet soy sauce to the pan and mix in well. Fry for about 1 minute, or until the meat is starting to get a little dry, and you can see it browning and sticking to the pan just a little. This browning adds a lot of great flavor.</li>
            <li>Add about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of water. Stir it around and fully deglaze the pan to get all that flavor mixed back into the sauce. Fry for about 30 seconds to reduce the water back into a nice brown gravy.</li>
            <li>Add the basil in, stirring quickly. Cook just for a few seconds, just long enough for the basil to wilt a little. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Serve along side some piping hot Thai Jasmine rice and top with a Kai Dow for a delicious one-dish meal, or serve on a small plate to be shared at the table for a family style meal.</li>
